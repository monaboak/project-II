        Los Angeles, commonly referred to by the initials L.A., is a sprawling
        Southern Californian city. Being the largest city in California, Los
        Angeles has an estimated population of almost 4 million. Los Angles is
        known world wide for being the entertainment capital of the world- it’s
        the epicentre for film and television. The city is also known for its
        notorious air quality. The dangerously poor air quality in Los Angeles
        has been an ongoing issue for decades now. This site’s purpose is to
        bring awareness to some of the major factors contributing to the air
        pollution in L.A., as listed below:

      <h1>Wildfires</h1>
      <p>
        Los Angeles is suffers from natural forest fires. These fires go two
        ways- they run their course and burn out within a matter of hours, or
        they take on a life of their own and engulf dozens of cities in the
        Southern Californian region.

    <!--car culture intro-->
    <div class="section-centered">
      <h1>Car Culture</h1>
      <p>
        Los Angeles differs from other populous cities -like New York, for
        example- in that it has a huge car culture. This crazed culture comes
        from the fact that L.A. is a metropolitan area, and the county is about
        4,700 miles wide.

    <!--ozone intro-->
    <div class="section-centered">
      <h1>Ozone</h1>
      <p>
        The Los Angeles region is susceptible to high ozone layers. Ozone is
        considered to be a reactive gas that is produced when the sun rays split
        oxygen molecules.
