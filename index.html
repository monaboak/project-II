    <p>
      Los Angeles, commonly referred to by the initials L.A., is a sprawling
      Southern Californian city. Being the largest city in California, Los
      Angeles has an estimated population of almost 4 million. Los Angles is
      known world wide for being the entertainment capital of the world- it’s
      the epicentre for film and television. The city is also known for its
      notorious air quality. The dangerously poor air quality in Los Angeles has
      been an ongoing issue for decades now. This site’s purpose is to bring
      awareness to some of the major factors contributing to the air pollution
      in L.A., as listed below:

    <!--wildfire intro -->
    <h2>Wildfires</h2>
    <p>
      Los Angeles is suffers from natural forest fires. These fires go two ways-
      they run their course and burn out within a matter of hours, or they take
      on a life of their own and engulf dozens of cities in the Southern
      Californian region.

    <!--car culture intro-->
    <h2>Car Culture</h2>
    <p>
      Los Angeles differs from other populous cities -like New York, for
      example- in that it has a huge car culture. This crazed culture comes from
      the fact that L.A. is a metropolitan area, and the county is about 4,700
      miles wide.

    <!--ozone intro-->
    <h1>Ozone</h1>
    <p>
      The Los Angeles region is susceptible to high ozone layers. Ozone is
      considered to be a reactive gas that is produced when the sun rays split
      oxygen molecules.
