          Los Angeles is suffers from natural forest fires. These fires go two
          ways- they run their course and burn out within a matter of hours, or
          they take on a life of their own and engulf dozens of cities in the
          Southern Californian region.

          The earliest recorded wildfire in Los Angeles was the Bel
          Air/Brentwood fires, in early November of 1961. Wildfires can result
          from a combination of factors. The most common are fire-happy shrubs
          and trees, fierce autumn winds, long droughts ended by heavy rainfall,
          etc. Sometimes, wildfires are man made- meaning they result from
          innocent accidents and end up getting out of control. An example of
          this occurred in late 2019, when a couple attempted to do a gender
          reveal in a forest North of L.A. and ended up catching a bush on fire-
          which ended up causing mass destruction to a majority of Los Angeles
          county.

        <h5>Exactly how do wildfires affect L.A. air quality?</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Wildfire smoke is contributing to the worst air quality in decades.
          What happens when these massive wildfires occur is that they release
          smoke into the air and end up covering several towns and cities in Los
          Angeles county in a thick, orange haze.

        <h5>What is the average Air Quality Index (AQI) during wildfires?</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The average AQI during wildfires is about 153. On a normal
          (non-wildfire) day, the average AQI score in Los Angeles is around 60.
