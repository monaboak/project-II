        <h1>Wildfires</h1>
        <p>
          Los Angeles is suffers from natural forest fires. These fires go two
          ways- they run their course and burn out within a matter of hours, or
          they take on a life of their own and engulf dozens of cities in the
          Southern Californian region.

          The earliest recorded wildfire in Los Angeles was the Bel
          Air/Brentwood fires, in early November of 1961. Wildfires can result
          from a combination of factors. The most common are fire-happy shrubs
          and trees, fierce autumn winds, long droughts ended by heavy rainfall,
          etc. Sometimes, wildfires are man made- meaning they result from
          innocent accidents and end up getting out of control. An example of
          this occurred in late 2019, when a couple attempted to do a gender
          reveal in a forest North of L.A. and ended up catching a bush on fire-
          which ended up causing mass destruction to a majority of Los Angeles
          county.
